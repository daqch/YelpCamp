 ### What will I learn apart from the above?
 
 - Work with Google Fonts and Bootstrap for front-end design
 - Learn about RESTful routing and back-end basics
 - Gather the basics of front-end and back-end to develop a working website
 - Set the initial milestone for future projects
 
If you want to see my annotations and apports to the standard project this repository will contain a "journal" md file according to my progress.
